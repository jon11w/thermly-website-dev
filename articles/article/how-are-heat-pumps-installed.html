                        Here at Thermly, we want to make it as easy - and simple - as possible for you to begin the
                        journey of bringing a heat pump into your home. It may seem that there’s a lot of information to
                        gather, wade through and understand before you can get to the point of installing a heat pump,
                        but we’re here to make everything very simple.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="heading-medium emerald font">
                        Here’s how heat pumps are installed
                    </h2>

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        You’re thinking of installing a heat pump but want to know more about how long it takes, and
                        what to expect when you install one? Well, read on!
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        At Thermly, we have a brilliant network of certified, trusted and local installers who will do
                        the work for you. But to arm you with information upfront, here’s a quick guide on how the
                        process with Thermly will work.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="heading-medium emerald font">
                        Step 1: Assessing whether a heat pump is suitable for your home
                    </h3>

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        Firstly, you need to find out if a heat pump is suitable for your home, and what specification
                        and components the system will need to work optimally.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        Our online heat pump readiness tool - <a class="article-link text-secondary"
                            href="https://platform.thermly.co.uk/heatpump-readiness">Heat Pump Readiness Assessment</a>
                        - will rapidly figure out if your home is heat pump ready. After a few simple questions, we’ll
                        answer that question for you and give you a personalised early estimate of the cost of
                        installation and the positive impact it could have.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        If your home is heat pump ready and you want to go further - we’ll match you with up to three
                        trusted, local and, importantly, certified installers who will suggest an appropriate heat pump
                        and installation budget for you. You can then select your preferred installer to take it from
                        there (we’re still on hand to help you on your heat pump journey, we’re here to support you when
                        you need us!).
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="heading-medium emerald font">
                        Step 2: Choosing your heat pump
                    </h3>

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        Your installer will visit to carry out a survey, which you’ll book through the Thermly platform.
                        The survey will take a couple of hours.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        Whilst undertaking the survey, the installer will also talk you through each part of the heat
                        pump and where and how it will be installed (check out our video, which gives you some info
                        about the space you need: <a class="article-link text-secondary"
                            href="https://youtu.be/u1TyPArQtWY">https://youtu.be/u1TyPArQtWY</a>).
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        The installer will need to go away and do a bunch of detailed calculations and design the system
                        in order to provide a full quotation (and all the relevant supplementary information) back to
                        you, which they will do through Thermly. You’ll be notified when that process is complete, and
                        everything will be downloadable via your login. Thermly keeps a full a record of all the
                        correspondence and documentation which you can access at any time, so you’re fully informed at
                        all stages of the process.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="heading-medium emerald font">
                        Step 3: Pre-installation
                    </h3>

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        The installation quotation will be based on agreeing the assumptions that any essential
                        insulation work – like loft insulation top up or cavity wall insulation – is completed by you
                        first. If you need to have the property insulated before progressing, you will need to get this
                        done before any heat pump installation takes place. Don’t worry, we can signpost you to local
                        partner schemes who can undertake this work. Another possibility is that you may need listed
                        building consent. Again you need to have this in place before work progresses.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        This may sound complicated, but we are there to guide you through it all.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        The installer will also notify the local power network that a heat pump is going to be
                        connected, and the network will respond to confirm either way. This can be as quick as
                        overnight, but it can also take 2 weeks...this bit is out of our hands I’m afraid! Again, we’ll
                        keep you informed on the platform about progress on this too, and you’ll be notified at each
                        stage.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="heading-medium emerald font">
                        Step 4: Installation
                    </h3>

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        Right, your air source heat pump is now ready to be installed! Typically, installation will take
                        between 3 – 5 days. The installer will have confirmed access is fine during the survey – and
                        will need unfettered access to the outdoor location where your heat pump is to be located.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        There’s no denying it, installation can be disruptive – the installers will be in and out of
                        your home for a few days whilst the internal and external components are installed, connected,
                        configured and commissioned. If at any time you have questions or are concerned about something,
                        do ask the installer: they’re there to help.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        Heat pumps aren’t like normal boilers, and they’re not used or controlled like normal boilers.
                        Your installer will configure the system in a way that will be appropriate for your home and
                        explain how the controls work. But we also need to manage expectations. Many people will take
                        time to get used to the new system and how it best operates. The settings may also need to be
                        adjusted in the weeks following installation so that it operation can be optimised. You need to
                        have patience on both counts – and the installer will revisit the property if needed to adjust
                        and tweak to ensure you’re getting the best out of the system.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="heading-medium emerald font">
                        Step 5: Post installation
                    </h3>

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        Once complete and you’re happy, you’ll be asked to sign the completion paperwork by your
                        installer. You can do this on site before the contractor leaves, or it will be uploaded to the
                        platform and you can sign it there, online.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        All your installation documentation will be uploaded to the Thermly platform, which you can
                        store there or download as required. At the moment, any ongoing maintenance – typically required
                        annually to maintain the warranty on a heat pump – can be arranged with your installer directly.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="heading-medium emerald font">
                        Conclusion

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
