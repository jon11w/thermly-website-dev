                        Thermly is an independent new green tech company. We help householders make their homes more
                        energy efficient by supporting them in making informed decisions about whether, when and how to
                        install a heat pump.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        The energy industry can be bewildering. We know we operate in a confused, fragmented and, dare
                        we say it, dry industry. Thermly doesn’t want to be any of these things. The tools people have
                        available to research heat pumps and other sustainable energy solutions are laborious, complex
                        and often baffling. Our digital platform is here to fix that – and before we launched into our
                        first region (in Somerset - <a href="/articles/article/somerset-launch.html"
                            class="article-link text-secondary">read about it here</a>) we undertook a series of
                        consumer trials to ensure the website and platform worked in the intuitive way people would
                        expect. Our aim? To provide a platform that supported consumers in areas they really care about
                        when it comes to switching to more sustainable heating solutions.

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        Working in a closed research environment is no substitute for the direct exposure you get from
                        speaking to consumers and the diversity of opinions and personal circumstances that come from
                        this. Our programme of face-to-face, structured consumer discussions was led by an independent
                        third party and has provided some incredibly valuable insights.

                        Our top two?

                    <ol class="text-standard emerald-font article-list">
                        <li style="list-style-type: decimal;"><b>Industry concerns are not the same as consumer
                                questions.</b>
                            By and large of course – there
                            are technically minded consumers out there. But whilst the industry is concerned with
                            questions of SCOP ratings, interoperability, network capacity, smart tariffs and accuracy of
                            heat pump calculations, the general public largely wants to know how heat pumps work, if
                            they’re noisy and will upset the neighbours, and how they can access Government grants.
                            Sounds simple, but it’s extremely important to acknowledge this, because it could be the
                            difference between homeowners switching to sustainable energy sources – or not.
                        </li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: decimal;"><b>These consumer questions are overwhelmingly coming from
                                a
                                positive place.</b> What we have
                            seen first-hand is a marked difference in the tone struck in relation to heat pumps by large
                            sections of the media and what consumers are actually thinking. They know that a heat pump
                            is a significant investment, but they are not hostile to that prospect – they intuitively
                            understand the environmental case for making a change and just want a trusted and
                            comprehensive source of information to give them the facts, tailored to their own homes.

                        We love consumer trials – it’s impossible to overstate how much we learn from them. These are
                        examples of just two of the lessons we learnt over the months-long set of trials. It’s important
                        that we can cut through the industry vernacular and the media doom mongering and be laser
                        focused on what homeowners <i>really care about</i>.

                        Thermly’s platform undertook some important changes in light of our consumer trial; while these
                        changes aren’t fundamental to the core of what Thermly promises – real, honest advice about heat
                        pumps – they are more about the usability of the platform so we are able to give homeowners the
                        real insight they are after. By doing that, we will arm them with the real knowledge they need
                        when it comes to making informed decisions about whether, when and how to install a heat pump.
