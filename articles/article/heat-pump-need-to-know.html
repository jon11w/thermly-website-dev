                        Heat pumps are an energy efficient, low carbon way to heat your home. They are suitable for many
                        types of home, you could get a £7,500 government grant to help with the installation costs, and
                        it could save you money on your energy bills. If you’re keen to have a heat pump in your home,
                        here are some things you will need to consider before having one installed. And don’t worry,
                        your installer will visit your home before having a heat pump installed to advise you on these
                        points, and design a heating system that works for your needs.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="heading-medium emerald-font">The type of heat pump</h3>

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        The type of heat pump that suits you and your home can usually be determined based on your
                        budget and how much space you have. There are two types of heat pump – air source and ground
                        source.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        Air source heat pumps are the most common for domestic use. You will need to find space for the
                        heat pump externally; the diagram below shows how big a heat pump typically is and the space
                        needed around it.
                    </p>

                    <div class="map-image-container">
                        <img class="map-image"
                            src="https://api.thermly.co.uk/images/heat_pump_readiness_outdoor_space/space_for_pump.svg"
                            alt="Heat pump dimensions" />
                    </div>

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        A ground source heat pump requires a large amount of outdoor space, with good access. It will
                        need underground pipes or boreholes to extract the energy from the ground, generally making them
                        more expensive to install.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        For all heat pumps you need space for a hot water cylinder inside the house. An airing cupboard
                        is ideal, although other locations around the home are possible too.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="heading-medium emerald-font">Underfloor heating and radiators</h3>

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        If you already have a wet underfloor heating system, this works well with a heat pump.
                        Underfloor heating, however, is not essential.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        You may need to consider switching out your radiators to those with a larger surface area, which
                        are more suited to heat pump systems. The larger the surface area, the more heat can be emitted
                        which is important because heat pumps run more efficiently at lower flow temperatures.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        However, radiators with larger surface areas don’t necessarily have to take up more space.
                        Radiators can be upgraded from single to double or triple panels to increase the surface area
                        without taking up extra wall space.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        Why do they need a larger surface area? To allow more heat into the room without needing to
                        increase the water temperature flowing through them. This is why the large surface areas of
                        underfloor heating works well with a heat pump too.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        Some homes built from the early 1970s onwards may have thinner pipework in radiators which is
                        less likely to be compatible with a heat pump. It’s known as ‘microbore’ pipework and has a
                        diameter of 12mm or less. Your installer – when they come to survey – will see if this is an
                        issue and advise if it needs replacing.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="heading-medium emerald-font">Heat pump efficiency</h3>

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        Heat pumps are more efficient than other heating systems and should generate around three more
                        times heat energy than the electricity they use.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        Each manufacturer provides a datasheet telling you the efficiency, known as the coefficient of
                        performance, or CoP. However, this could vary depending on external temperatures and changes
                        throughout the year – the seasonal CoP, or SCoP. This will also vary depending on system design
                        and flow temperature, which is bespoke to your home.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        Your installer will calculate this for you based on the system design for your home, which will
                        give you a better idea of the running costs before you go ahead with installation.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="heading-medium emerald-font">Installation costs</h3>

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        The costs to install a heat pump depend on which type you are installing. Typically, an air
                        source heat pump costs between £10,000 and £20,000 to install, but that’s not going to help you
                        make a decision, is it? Take our <a href="https://platform.thermly.co.uk/heatpump-readiness"
                            class="article-link text-secondary">heat pump readiness test</a> to get a more accurate
                        estimate of the cost of an air source heat pump for your home. It’ll take about 2 minutes.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        Ground source heat pumps have much higher installation costs than air source heat pumps, and it
                        would be tricky to provide an accurate estimate here as the variables can be significant. Let’s
                        say anywhere between £15,000 and £50,000!
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        The government provides grants through its Boiler Upgrade Scheme for heat pumps to help cover
                        the installation costs, and it’s a nice, tidy sum at £7,500.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="heading-medium emerald-font">Insulation</h3>

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        Heat pumps work better in well insulated homes. However, your home does not need to be fully
                        insulated for a heat pump to work. Before installation, our installers will calculate your
                        home’s heat loss, and therefore the likely size of the heat pump. Improving the insulation of
                        your home will reduce your heating costs, however, in some homes upgrading the insulation may
                        not be cost-effective.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        Whilst the Government announced in March 2023 that homes do not need to have cavity wall or loft
                        insulation to secure the £7,500 grant towards the installation cost, we still absolutely
                        recommend this work is carried out before you get a heat pump. Thermly is working with local
                        partner schemes for insulation and can point you in the right direction to get that done too.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="heading-medium emerald-font">Planning permission</h3>

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        The good news is you probably don’t need planning permission to install a heat pump, however it
                        is always good to get this checked to avoid problems down the line – who wants that!
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="heading-medium emerald-font">Timing</h3>

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        It can take several months from start to finish to have a heat pump installed. The reasons for
                        this are too many to mention here. However, with the launch of our Thermly in Somerset programme
                        in 2024, having a heat pump installed through us can significantly speed up the process. That
                        journey starts <a href="https://platform.thermly.co.uk/heatpump-readiness"
                            class="article-link text-secondary">here</a>.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        There are a small number of things simply outside our control, and the installer’s control, that
                        you need to be aware of. Firstly – the network. The installer will need to notify your local
                        electricity network of the intent to install a heat pump. They undertake checks to make sure
                        there is enough juice to serve the property. This is getting much quicker than it used to be,
                        but you should expect a couple of weeks’ delay whilst that happens.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        Secondly, you. You need to know this is right, so take your time in making the decision, don’t
                        rush, and make sure you’re happy to proceed. If you’re unsure about anything, ask the question.
                        You’ll find a bunch of useful information here, but your installer will also help. We will never
                        rush you into making a decision.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        Regarding the time it takes to actually install the heat pump itself, this is typically between
                        three and five days.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        Don’t worry, installed in the right place, a heat pump won’t attract complaints from your
                        neighbours! Research suggests they produce a similar noise level to that of a fridge or gas
                        boiler, meaning you could hold a normal conversation standing next to one. We have more

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        There will be some disruption when having a heat pump installed. Work may include building a
                        plinth outside for a heat pump to stand on, installing new pipework, replacing or installing a
                        hot water cylinder and upgrading radiators. However, your installer will keep disruption to a
                        minimum.
