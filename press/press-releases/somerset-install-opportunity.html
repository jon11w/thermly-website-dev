                        sustainable living
                    </h2>

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        1<sup>st</sup> May 2024: Data by green tech company, Thermly, has found that 85% of all homes
                        in the Somerset region are suitable for the installation of a heat pump. The data shows that
                        from a total of 252,813 residential properties in the Somerset Council area, 212,589 could
                        benefit from the installation of a heat pump.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        Gareth Robertson, co-founder of Thermly, said: “Somerset is a very forward-thinking,
                        green-minded part of the country and with so many eligible properties, the opportunity to
                        future-proof homes and move us all towards more sustainable energy choices is significant.”
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        Thermly Hub, which provided data for this study - and which also provides the data for the UK’s
                        Green Building Council’s (UKGBC <a href="https://ukgbc.org"
                            class="article-link text-secondary">https://ukgbc.org</a>) national level housing analysis
                        tool - also
                        found that if every property that could benefit from a heat pump in the region actually
                        converted to the technology, the overall environmental impact would be enormous. Somerset would
                        generate a lifetime saving of over 12 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions, and a 61.5
                        billion kWh reduction in energy usage*.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        Gareth Robertson continues: “The UK Government is working towards a net zero target by 2050,
                        with the aim of installing 600,000 heat pumps each year by 2028 to help meet this ambition. Many
                        may think it's the Government's responsibility to meet these targets, but it is in fact all of
                        our responsibility to look after the world in which we live.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        At Thermly, we want to support homeowners in making planet positive decisions, so we help them
                        install heat pumps quickly and easily, enabling an energy efficient, low carbon way to heat
                        homes and futureproofing them for years to come. As these figures show, we can reduce the amount
                        of carbon dioxide emissions our homes release and the amount of energy we use across our
                        lifetimes.”
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        Thermly has recently announced its partnership with <a href="https://retrofitsomerset.info/"
                            class="article-link text-secondary">Retrofit Somerset</a>, a collaborative project to
                        support the installation of heat pumps into homes across the Somerset region.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        This first-of-its-kind project will pave the way for a large-scale roll-out of heat pump
                        installations in homes. Initial phases will focus on rural locations around Yeovil, areas
                        already agreed with Retrofit Somerset.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        Thermly’s programme will help homeowners install heat pumps quickly and easily, enabling an
                        energy efficient, low carbon way to heat their homes and futureproofing them for years to come.
                        Every eligible home is able to access £7,500 in government funding towards the cost of
                        installation, and all the installations will be undertaken by Somerset-based companies. In
                        addition, Thermly is providing an additional £1000 of funding for each of the first 20
                        households installing a heat pump in Somerset through the Thermly platform.
