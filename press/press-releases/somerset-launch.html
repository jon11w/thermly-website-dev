                        1<sup>st</sup> May 2024: Green tech company, Thermly, announces the launch of its partnership
                        with Retrofit Somerset, a long-term collaboration that will support the installation of heat
                        pumps into homes, benefitting up to 40,000 homeowners.

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        This first-of-its-kind project will pave the way for a large-scale, Somerset-wide roll-out of
                        heat pump installations in homes. Initial phases will focus on rural locations in the southeast
                        of Somerset in areas already agreed with Retrofit Somerset, with planned expansion into the
                        whole of the county in due course.

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        Thermly will help homeowners install heat pumps quickly and easily, enabling an energy
                        efficient, low carbon way to heat their homes and futureproofing them for years to come. Every
                        eligible home will also be able to access £7,500 in government funding towards the cost of
                        installation, and all the installations will be undertaken by Somerset-based companies.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        Chris Gaskell from Retrofit Somerset, said: “As a project looking at ways to overcome barriers
                        to delivering retrofit action across Somerset, we are delighted to partner with the Thermly
                        platform. It will help homeowners identify if their home is suitable for upgrading their heating
                        to a heat pump. This will help reduce the use of high carbon-emitting fossil fuels and allow
                        them to heat their homes and water with a more energy efficient technology. The Thermly app will
                        also help homeowners connect to local heat pump installers to make their installation journey as
                        easy and efficient as possible. We look forward to working together to help more people get a
                        heat pump installed.”

                        Gareth Robertson, one of the founders of Thermly, said: “We are on a mission to change the way
                        we heat our homes. At Thermly, we make it super simple to install a heat pump by helping you
                        work out if one is right for you, matching you with the right local installer and helping you
                        access finance quickly if you need it. This locally driven partnership is the first-of-its-kind
                        in the UK and we’re excited that such a green-minded community are as keen as us to future-proof
                        homes and move us all towards more sustainable energy choices.”

                        What is a heat pump?
                    </h3>

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        A heat pump is a technology that is used to heat your home, instead of a conventional boiler.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        The proven technology used for heat pumps has been around for decades, making them a tried and
                        tested way to heat homes in an energy efficient way, using small amounts of electricity to
                        extract, move and enhance the heat that’s already in the air or ground - into your home.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-standard emerald-font">
                        Heat pumps are three to five times more efficient – for every kWh of electricity used, heat
                        pumps should generate 3kWh of heat for your home. This lowers your carbon emissions, removes
                        reliance on fossil fuels like gas and oil, which is much better for the environment.

                        Retrofit Somerset is a partnership project funded by MCS Foundation to support the acceleration

                        Somerset Council, Somerset Independence Plus, Bruton, Frome and Glastonbury Town Councils,
                        Lendology, Centre for Sustainable Energy, Burham and Weston Community Energy. Part of this
                        project is to trial solutions that will help inform homeowners on what retrofit solution they
                        will benefit from to reduce bills, improve health and wellbeing and reduce carbon emissions.
